# ðŸ§  WorldOS

**WorldOS** is a secure, containerized execution layer for each world. Think of it as a microkernel for spatial apps.

## Responsibilities

- Sandbox JS World API usage
- Manage VEML-defined permissions
- Isolate per-user execution contexts
- Enforce interaction rate-limits and ownership

WorldOS ensures that even remixable or forked worlds remain safe, predictable, and maintain creator intent.
