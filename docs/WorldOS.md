# ðŸ§  WorldOS

**WorldOS** is a modular, distributed runtime framework that manages execution, communication, and coordination between applications inside and across worlds. Inspired by the Robot Operating System (ROS), it treats each world as an orchestrated system of services, triggers, and behaviors.

## ðŸ”Œ Core Architecture

- **Message Bus**: Built on [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/), enabling low-latency, pub/sub-style event communication across world components
- **App-Oriented Design**: Worlds can register or instantiate *apps* (scripts, logic handlers, services) that listen for specific topics
- **Interoperable & Dynamic**: Apps can be written in different languages or deployed across containerized nodes

## ðŸ“¦ Apps in WorldOS

Apps are pluggable and reactive units. Each app:

- Subscribes to one or more MQTT topics
- Can publish outbound messages (e.g. for other apps or world state)
- Can be ephemeral (triggered once) or long-lived

### Example Topics

```plaintext
world/zone01/enter
world/crate_01/trigger/open
